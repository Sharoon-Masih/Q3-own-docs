# assignment : =, +=, -=
# arithematic: +, -, *, /
# comparison: >, <, >=, <=, ==, != etc
# logical: NOT, AND, OR 

a = 1
#  a++ #python does not have incre/decre unary operator, but we achieve this thing by doing it like this:
a += 1; #incre by 1 
a -= 1; #decre by 1

# always remember the comparison return boolean value like:
n1 = 5 > 7 #it returns false.
n2 = 5 < 7 #it returns true.

# logical op
# must remember truth table while working with logical op.
# in python:
# || = or (in python we dont use symbol rather than it we use correct english word. )
# && = and
# ! = not

check = True or False # true
check1 = True and False # false
check2 = not(True) # false
check2 = not(False) # true
