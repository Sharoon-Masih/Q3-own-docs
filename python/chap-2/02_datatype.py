# there are primarily/primitive four types of data type:
# string
# integer
# boolean
# float
# none

a = "haha" # type of a is string
b = 1 # type of b is integer
c = True # type of c is boolean
d = 1.0 # type of d is float
e = None #type of e is none. 

# Now baki toh sari types ka pta hai but what is none?
# None is a special type of data type which is used to represent the absence of a value.basically it is like 'undefined' which means that if we want to declare undefined variable we can not do like this:
# f; //error
f = None #same as undefined, and no error.
